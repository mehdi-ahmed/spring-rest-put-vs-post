# Post vs Put Dilemma

    - The POST method call will create a child resource under a collection of resources.
    - The PUT method call will either create a new resource or update an existing one.
    - PUT is an idempotent method, while POST isnâ€™t:
        - For instance, calling the PUT method multiple times will either create or update the same resource. 
        - In contrast, multiple POST requests will lead to the creation of the same resource multiple times.
